<h2>Directives</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Makes up the heart and soul of what distinguishes Angular from other JS libraries and frameworks (Backbone, Ember)</li>
	<li>Directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element</li>
</ul>
