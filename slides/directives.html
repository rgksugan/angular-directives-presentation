<h2>Directives</h2>

<p>Makes up the heart and soul of what distinguishes Angular from other JS libraries and frameworks (Backbone, Ember)</p>
<br>
<p>Directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element</p>
