<h3>Forms</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Element names</li>
	<li>Attributes</li>
	<li>Class names</li>
	<li>Comments</li>

Best Practice: Prefer using directives via tag name and attributes over comment and class names. Doing so generally makes it easier to determine what directives a given element matches.

<p class="alert alert-success">
Best Practice: Comment directives were commonly used in places where the DOM API limits the ability to create directives that spanned multiple elements (e.g. inside <table> elements). AngularJS 1.2 introduces ng-repeat-start and ng-repeat-end as a better solution to this problem. Developers are encouraged to use this over custom comment directives when possible.
